# Why

I created this bot as a way to track Black Friday deals online. Typically, people/bots post on the social media site, Reddit, about what deals are popping up and what category they are. Whether that be Tech or Cooking, it can be tracked. 

I was also in the process of adding a "keyword-pinger" that would notify specific users if a post containing user-specified keywords was grabbed. The basic iteration of this is in the main file, but was never added on to.
